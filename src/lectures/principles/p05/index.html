                    <p>In the <a href="../l04/">previous lecture</a>, we learnt the theory behind precise calibration of
                        photometry, enabling us to put photometric observations onto a standard scale with precisions of
                        better than 1%. In this practical we are going to learn how to produce calibrated photometry
                        using a simplified method. This method does not yield the same accuracy as an analysis using
                        observations of primary or secondary standard stars, combined with the use of colour terms. On
                        the other hand, it is much simpler to apply, and even works to produce calibrated photometry
                        through thin cloud. If you are happy to accept accuracies on the order of a few percent, I
                        recommend using the method described below whenever you need to produce calibrated photometry.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this practical, we will produce a colour-magnitude diagram of the young open cluster NGC 869,
                        using readily available software. First, I describe the method which will enable us to obtain
                        calibrated magnitudes. </p>
                    <h5>Method</h5>
                    <p>In the last lecture we saw that, for any star, the difference between the calibrated magnitude,
                        \(m\) and the above-atmosphere instrumental magnitude \(m_{0,i}\) is given by:
                        \[m = m_{0,i} + m_{\rm zp},\]
                        where \(m_{\rm zp}\) is known as the zero point. The above-atmosphere instrumental magnitude is
                        given by:
                        \[m_{0,i} = m_i - kX,\]
                        where \(m_i = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( N_t/t_{\rm exp} \right)\) is the instrumental magnitude,
                        \(k\) is the extinction coefficient, and \(X\) is the airmass. Therefore:
                        \[m = m_i - kX + m_{\rm zp}.\]
                        In other words, if we were to plot the calibrated magnitude \(m\) against instrumental magnitude
                        \(m_i\) for all the stars in our image, we would expect a straight line, with a gradient of one,
                        and an intercept equal to \( kX + m_{\rm zp} \). This intercept could then be added to all of
                        our instrumental magnitudes to produce calibrated magnitudes. </p>
                    <p>What makes this technique possible, is the existence of large sky surveys, which have provided
                        calibrated magnitudes for many, relatively bright stars over a very wide areas of the sky. If
                        your data is covered by one of these surveys, and it provides calibrated magnitudes in the same
                        filter as your data, you can apply this technique relatively quickly.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Accuracy</strong></h6>
                    <p>The accuracy this technique can achieve is limited by two factors. First of all we are not taking
                        into account any secondary effects, such as 2nd-order extinction, or colour terms. Secondly, our
                        photometry cannot be any more accurate than that in the sky survey we use. Typically, large sky
                        surveys achieve accuracies of a few percent. Ignoring the secondary effects will probably
                        introduce errors on a similar level. If you need calibrated photometry to better than a few
                        percent, you will have to observe standard stars, and apply the rigorous method described in the
                        <a href="../l04/">previous lecture</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Steps</strong></h6>
                    <p>Applying this method requires the application of four steps. These steps are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>astrometric solution of the image - so we know the RA and Dec of all the stars we measure in
                            our image;</li>
                        <li>finding the stars in our image, and calculating instrumental magnitudes;</li>
                        <li>matching our stars against a sky-survey, so we know instrumental and calibrated magnitude
                            for many stars;</li>
                        <li>calculating the offset between instrumental and calibrated magnitudes, and applying to all
                            stars in our image.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>We will need to use several software packages to perform these steps and achieve our goal.
                        Following the guide below will show you how to achieve this with readily available,
                        cross-platform software packages. </p>
                    <h5>The Data</h5>
                    <p>You will need a copy of the data. The data files are located at
                        <kbd>C:\SharedFolder\astrolab\NGC869\Images</kbd>.
                    </p>
                    <p>You don't need to copy the data from this location to work on it, but this folder is local to the
                        PC you are working on now. If you want to save these files for later, you will need to copy them
                        to your M: or U: drives. </p>

                    <h5>Astrometric Calibration</h5>
                    <p>Eventually we are going to match our instrumental magnitudes for each star, against calibrated
                        magnitudes from a catalog which comprises of RA, Dec and magnitude. Thus we will need to know
                        the RA and Dec of every star we calculate an instrumental magnitude. We do this by ensuring the
                        image file has an astrometric solution - a piece of metadata which allows software to convert
                        between pixel positions (x, y) and sky coordinates (RA, Dec). </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">For the data in today's practical, this step has already been carried
                        out, and the image has an astrometric solution already. This section is included for reference
                        if you use these notes to reduce your open cluster data. If you are just working through the
                        practical, skip ahead to the section on <a href="#apphot">aperture photometry</a>. </p>
                    <p>You can create an astrometric solution for your images using AstroImageJ, which we encountered in
                        the <a href="../p03/">previous practical</a>. AstroImageJ has a tool to automatically find the
                        RA and Dec of an astronomical image, using an online web tool called Astrometry.net. To use this
                        service, you will need to sign up for an account at http://nova.astrometry.net. Once you have
                        logged in, go to "Profile" and make a note of the API key listed there - you will need it to use
                        astrometry.net from within AstroImageJ. </p>

                                Options</kbd> control how stars are detected in the image. You probably want to uncheck
                            these to start with, but if your images are very noisy, <kbd>Median Filter</kbd> can prevent
                            the spurious identification of noise as stars. <kbd>Peak Find Options</kbd> can be used to
                            prevent the use of <a href="../../instruments/l11/">saturated stars</a>, whose positions are
                            unreliable.

                        <p>The option <kbd>SIP Distortion Correction</kbd> will enable a more complex transformation

                            You should usually check this box. </p>
                        <p>Astrometry.net can usually find a solution for many images without an initial guess of the RA
                            and Dec of the image. Try this by entering your astrometry.net API Key into the <kbd>User
                                Key</kbd> box and clicking <kbd>Start</kbd>. Check the output log to see if the
                            astrometric solution was successful.</p>
                        <p>If it wasn't, you may need to give Astrometry.net some constraints on the image location. To
                            do so we need to know the rough position the telescope was pointed at and the image scale
                            (in arc seconds per pixel). In our case, the RA was roughly 02:18:57 and the Dec was roughly
                            +57 08 46. The image was taken with 2x2 binning, and so the pixel scale is 1 arc second per
                            pixel (image scales for the Hicks Observatory can be found here). You can make
                            Astrometry.net search only around these values by ticking the <kbd>Constrain Plate
                                Scale</kbd> and the <kbd>Constrain Sky Location</kbd> checkboxes, and entering
                            appropriate values in the relevant text boxes.</p>

                    <h5>Aperture Photometry</h5>
                    <p>We have done aperture photometry <a href="../p03/">before</a>, using <a
                            href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/">AstroImageJ</a>. Whilst this
                        tool is excellent for relative photometry, and producing light curves, each aperture must be
                        placed by hand, which makes it onerous to use when we want to measure every star in an image.
                        For this reason I will introduce a new software tool, the <a
                            href="http://www.aperturephotometry.org/">Aperture Photometry Tool</a>, or APT for
                        short. </p>
                    <p>APT can be installed on Windows, Linux or Mac machines. There is excellent <a
                            href="https://www.aperturephotometry.org/features-functions/">documentation</a>, and a
                        35-minute long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lXAWfBW_NQ">video tutorial</a>. Should
                        you need to perform aperture photometry on a large number of stars in your course, it is a good
                        place to start.</p>
                    <p>APT is installed on the astrolab machines under <kbd>C:\SharedFolder\astrolab\APT_v2.4.7</kbd>.
                        Double click on the Application in this folder to run APT. </p>

                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 2: </strong>Setup APT.</p>
                        <p>Start APT and click <kbd>Open Image</kbd> to load your astrometrically calibrated image.
                            Click on <kbd>More Settings</kbd> and make sure the <kbd>source algorithm</kbd> is set to
                            <kbd>model 0</kbd> (this is straightforward aperture photometry), and the <kbd>sky
                                algorithm</kbd> is set to <kbd>model B</kbd> (this will use a sky annulus to measure and
                            subtract the sky background). Click <kbd>Apply Settings</kbd> and then <kbd>Close
                                Window</kbd>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now we need to set our aperture settings, but we'll need to find the FWHM so we know roughly
                            what settings to use. Click on an isolated star in the image to place an aperture around it.
                            Then click on <kbd>Aperture Slice</kbd>. You will see a plot with two cross sections across
                            your star, one horizontal, one vertical (see, for example, {%figref "aperture_slice" %}).
                            You can use this plot to estimate the FWHM of stars in your image. </p>
                        <p>Once you know the FWHM, use it to set the values for your photometry apertures. You should
                            have some experience in this from the relative photometry practicals, but decent starting
                            values are an object aperture radius of 1.5xFWHM, an inner sky radius of 2xFWHM and an outer
                            sky radius of 3xFWHM. </p>
                        <p>Click on the big button in the GUI (labelled something like <kbd>5/5/0 -> Alter</kbd>) to set
                            the aperture parameters. Two windows should appear. The <kbd>Major radius</kbd> in the
                            larger window is where you enter the object aperture. Click <kbd>Apply</kbd>. The sky
                            annulus radii are entered in the smaller window. Set these values and click
                            <kbd>Apply</kbd>. <kbd>Close</kbd> both windows.
                        </p>

                        it. Have a go at this, and look at the values reported in the <kbd>Aperture Photometry
                            Results</kbd> area of the APT window. However, we want to detect all the stars in the image,
                        and perform aperture photometry on all of them at once.</p>

                            settings are the detection threshold, which sets how bright an object must be to be
                            detected, and the <kbd>Radial-profile sigma</kbd> which gives APT an idea how large the
                            stars in the image will be. This last value wants to be at least twice the FWHM.
                        </p>
                        <p>When the settings are correct, click <kbd>Create Source List</kbd>, and close the window once

                    <h5>Photometric Calibration</h5>
                    <p>Now you should have a CSV file, called <kbd>NGC869_B.csv</kbd>, with your instrumental magnitudes
                        (and much besides) in it. The next step is photometric calibration. As a reminder, this involves
                        fitting a straight line to a graph of instrumental magnitude against calibrated magnitude, to
                        find the offset between the two. </p>
                    <p>This can be done inside APT itself, but slightly annoyingly APT requires files in a new format.
                        The file format is space-separated, with three columns: RA, Dec and Magnitude. To get our
                        instrumental magnitude data into this format, and to download calibrated magnitudes covering our
                        image, we will introduce a new tool - <a
                            href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">Topcat</a>.</p>
                    <p>Topcat is an amazing tool for manipulating tables of astronomical data, and for accessing the
                        wealth of data available over the web. Like all the software used in this practical it is
                        cross-platform and freely available. It's rich functionality is described in <a
                            href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/#docs">detailed documentation</a>. Topcat is
                        installed on the astrolab machines under <kbd>C:\SharedFolder\astrolab\topcat</kbd>.</p>

                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Start Topcat and load your instrumental magnitude file by choosing
                            <kbd>File > Load Table</kbd>. The load table dialog is used to load data from a wide range
                            of sources, including web-based catalog data, so it is slightly complex. You will need to
                            set the <kbd>Format</kbd> drop-down box to CSV and navigate to your file
                            (<kbd>NGC869_B.csv</kbd>) using the <kbd>System Browser</kbd>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now we will save our data to a simple text format, but we only want three columns - RA, Dec
                            and Magnitude. To control which columns are shown in Topcat, and which columns are exported
                            choose <kbd>Views > Column Info</kbd>. Make sure the only columns ticked are
                            <kbd>ApertureRA</kbd>, <kbd>ApertureDec</kbd> and <kbd>Magnitude</kbd>. Close the column
                            info window.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now export our data by choosing <kbd>File > Save Table(s)/Session</kbd>. Set the <kbd>output
                                format</kbd> to ascii and choose a save location using the <kbd>System Browser</kbd>.
                            Name your file <kbd>NGC869_B_instrumental_mags.txt</kbd>.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Now we have one of the two files required. We need to get catalog data for this part of the sky,
                        and in the correct filter. The <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6182">UCAC4</a> catalog is a
                        catalog which combines other sky surveys to provide data in many filters across much of the sky.
                        Crucially, in this case it includes B and V magnitudes, the two filters used for NGC 869. We can
                        download the part of the UCAC4 catalog we need, and export to the correct format, using Topcat.
                    </p>

                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Inside Topcat, choose <kbd>VO > VizieR Catalogue Service</kbd>. In
                            the window that opens, make sure the <kbd>Cone Selection</kbd> checkbox is selected. Enter
                            NGC 869 in the <kbd>Object Name</kbd>, and click <kbd>Resolve</kbd>. Topcat will fill in the
                            RA and Dec for NGC 869 for you. Next we set the area of catalog we want to download. Our
                            image is about 20 arc minutes on it's long edge, so set the Radius box to 40 arcmins. </p>
                        <p>In the <kbd>Catalogue Selection</kbd> part of the window, make sure the <kbd>Surveys</kbd>
                            tab is active, select the UCAC4 survey. Check your settings against {%figref "topcat_vizier"
                            %} and click <kbd>OK</kbd> . Topcat will download the UCAC4 catalogue, and a new table will
                            appear in the main topcat window ({%figref "topcat_mw" %}). </p>
                        <p>We are almost ready to export our UCAC4 data in the same way we did with the instrumental
                            magnitudes. First, however, make sure the UCAC4 table is selected in the main topcat window
                            and choose <kbd>Views > Table Data</kbd>. Notice that not every star has a B-band magnitude
                            (the column labelled <kbd>Bmag</kbd>). We will need to create a subset of the table,
                            containing only those stars with B-band magnitudes. </p>
                        <p>Close the table browser. In the main topcat window, choose <kbd>Views > Row Subsets</kbd>. In
                            the window that appears, choose <kbd>Subsets > New Subset</kbd>. Give your subset a name,
                            and enter "<kbd>! NULL_Bmag</kbd>" into the expression box. This will select only those
                            values where the Bmag is not NULL (i.e empty). In the main topcat window, select your subset
                            from the <kbd>Row Subset</kbd> drop down box and choose <kbd>Views > Table Data</kbd> again.
                            Notice that topcat is now only showing the stars with B-band magnitudes. </p>
                        <p>Follow the same steps you took in Task 6, to save an ascii file containing only these three
                            columns; <kbd>RAJ2000</kbd>, <kbd>DEJ2000</kbd>, <kbd>Bmag</kbd>. Call this file

                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 8:</strong> In APT, choose <kbd>Tools > Simple Photometric Calibration</kbd>.
                            The calibration window will appear ({%figref "apt_calib" %}). Select your saved instrumental
                            magnitude data (<kbd>NGC869_B_instrumental_mags.txt</kbd>) by clicking the <kbd>Choose
                                Uncalibrated Source List</kbd> button. Do the same for the UCAC4 data

                        <p>When we run the tool, it will match the two lists by looking for stars with similar RAs and
                            Decs. We can set the tolerance for this match in the <kbd>Match Radius</kbd> box. Set this
                            to 2 arcseconds. </p>
                        <p>Click the <kbd>Match Source Lists and Compute Zero Point</kbd> button. You should get a

                            the console window (top-right). In this case, the zero point is \(24.24 \pm 0.05\)
                            magnitudes. This is the difference between the calibrated and instrumental magnitudes, and
                            should be added to all of your instrumental magnitudes to give calibrated B-band magnitudes.
                        </p>
                        <p>The uncertainty in your zero point is important. Changing the zero point will change the

                            your zero point should not be combined with the measurement uncertainties in your
                            instrumental magnitude. It will, however, act as a <strong>systematic error</strong> on the
                            position of stars in your CMD. </p>
                        <p>We can make our final, calibrated catalog in topcat. Make sure the table containing the

                            "<kbd>Bmag</kbd>" and in the expression box, type "Magnitude + 24.24", where 24.24 should be
                            replaced with the zero point you found in your data. </p>

                        <p>Finally, make a CMD by plotting B-V on the x-axis against V on the y-axis. You can do this
                            either by using the <kbd>Graphics</kbd> options in Topcat, or by exporting the new catalog
                            to CSV format and reading it into Excel. You should end up with something like {%figref
                            "cmd_ngc869" %}.</p>
