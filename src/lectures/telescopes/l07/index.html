                    <h5>Using Mirrors</h5>
                    <p><a href="../l06/">Chromatic aberration</a> is the most serious aberration that affects any
                        optical telescope. It is, however, easily avoided. Reflecting telescopes use mirrors to collect
                        and focus light. Since these rely on reflection, and not refraction, they are free from
                        chromatic aberration. Mirrors are also simpler than lenses in that they only have a single
                        optical surface. Mirrors are usually made of a rigid, hard (i.e. polishable) material with a low
                        thermal expansion coefficient (such as the glass Pyrex), and coated with a thin layer of
                        aluminium, silver or gold to give high reflectivity. A telescope which uses a mirror to collect
                        and focus light is known as a reflector.</p>
                    <p id="spherical">Reflectors, are not aberration free, however. The easiest mirror to make is a
                        spherical mirror. {%figref "spherical_parabola", true %} shows that the rays from the edge of a
                        spherical mirror come to a focus nearer the mirror than do rays from the centre of the mirror,
                        causing a point source to be imaged as a blurred disc. This defect is known as spherical
                        aberration.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Spherical Aberration and Parabolic Mirrors</strong></h6>
                    <p>
                        The effects of spherical aberration in mirrors can be reduced by positioning the focal plane
                        coincident with the circle of least confusion, as shown in {%figref "spherical_parabola" %}, but
                        this still leaves an unsatisfactory blurring of the image. However, the Scottish astronomer
                        James Gregory realised in 1663 that spherical aberration can be eliminated if the curve of the
                        surface of a mirror is a parabola. This is also shown in {%figref "spherical_parabola" %}, where
                        all on-axis rays parallel to the axis of a parabolic mirror are reflected to meet at the <a
                            href="http://www.physicsinsights.org/parabola_focus.html">focus of the parabola</a>.</p>
                    <p>Creating mirrors with parabolic surfaces is not straightforward, as special grinding and
                        polishing techniques are required in order to create the deeper central depression of a parabola
                        compared to a spherical surface. A famous example of spherical aberration is given by the Hubble
                        Space Telescope (HST), which suffered from spherical aberration due to a mistake during the
                        manufacture of its (hyperbolic) 2.4m mirror, as shown in {%figref "hst_aberration" %}.
                        Corrective
                        optics were later installed by astronauts on a space shuttle servicing mission and the telescope
                        is now functioning perfectly.</p>

                    <p>It should be noted that lenses, and hence <a href="../l06/">refractors</a>, suffer from spherical
                        aberration in exactly the same way as mirrors, but it is a much smaller effect than chromatic
                        aberration. Spherical aberration can be eliminated from refractors using aspheric lenses, in
                        which the curvature of the surfaces is not constant, but these are difficult and expensive to
                        produce. It is more common to remove spherical aberration from refractors by designing achromats
                        in such a way that the negative lens cancels out the spherical aberration introduced by the
                        positive lens, whilst still correcting for chromatic aberration.</p>

                    <h5>Off-Axis Aberrations</h5>
                    <p>Parabolic mirrors only bring on-axis light to a single point of focus. In {%figref
                        "parabola_offaxis_rays" %}, we see what happens when off-axis sources are imaged using a
                        parabolic mirror. We can see that the light is not brought to a well-defined focus, thus
                        producing off-axis aberrations. Note that these aberrations are not unique to parabolic mirrors:
                        refractors and spherical mirrors suffer from them too. Due to their nature, off-axis aberrations
                        affect objects imaged at the edges of the field of view.</p>

                    <h5>Reflecting Telescope Designs</h5>
                    <h6><strong>Newtonian Reflectors</strong></h6>
                    <p>James Gregory was never able to bring his telescope design, known as the Gregorian, into
                        practical use, and it is Isaac Newton who is credited with making the first working reflecting
                        telescope in 1668. His design, known as the Newtonian, is shown in {%figref "newtonian" %}. The
                        Newtonian is a two-mirror telescope in which the first mirror in the light path, known as the
                        primary, is a concave parabola. The secondary mirror has no curvature at all and is hence
                        referred to as a flat. It simply folds the light through 90&deg;, placing the focal plane just
                        outside the incoming beam. The focal ratio at the Newtonian focus is typically about 5. The
                        secondary mirror is inclined at an angle of 45&deg; with respect to the primary. The base of the
                        flat is actually elliptical in shape so as to minimise the size of the circular shadow it casts
                        on the primary.</p>
                    <p>Although small amateur telescopes still adopt a Newtonian configuration, visual access to the
                        focus becomes inconvenient as the telescope becomes larger, and mounting instrumentation there
                        would unbalance the telescope, as demonstrated in {% figref "newtonian" %}. Hence Newtonians are
                        rarely found in professional observatories.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Cassegrain Reflectors</strong></h6>
                    <p>In 1672, the French priest Laurent Cassegrain developed another reflecting telescope design which
                        is now named after him - the Cassegrain. This design, shown in {%figref "cassegrain" %}, has
                        been adopted by the majority of the world's largest telescopes due to the convenience of
                        mounting instrumentation at the focus.</p>
                    <p>The Cassegrain telescope has a concave parabolic primary mirror like the Newtonian, but it
                        employs a convex hyperbolic secondary. This increases the focal length of the telescope and
                        reflects the beam back towards the primary, where it passes through a hole bored in the centre
                        of the mirror and comes to a focus just below it. This is a much more easily accessible focus
                        than the Newtonian, and an ideal place to mount large and heavy instrumentation. Compared to a
                        Newtonian, nothing is lost by having a hole in the primary, as this region of the mirror lies
                        under the shadow of the secondary. Moreover, because the beam is folded back on itself, it is
                        possible to have a much longer focal length telescope without a correspondingly long tube: the
                        focal ratio of a typical Cassegrain focus is 15.</p>
                    <p>Another advantage of the Cassegrain design for professional observatories is that removing the
                        secondary mirror gives access to <strong>prime focus</strong>. This is equivalent to the
                        Newtonian, and provides a much smaller focal ratio and hence larger field of view than the
                        Cassegrain focus. The wider field makes prime-focus imaging more susceptible to off-axis
                        aberrations than Cassegrain-focus imaging, hence lens-based correctors are usually required at
                        prime focus.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Ritchey-Chretien reflectors</strong></h6>
                    <p>Both the Newtonian and Cassegrain telescopes suffer from significant off-axis aberrations,
                        primarily coma. To remedy this, the American and French optical designers George Ritchey and
                        Henri Chretien jointly developed the Ritchey-Chretien telescope around 1910. The
                        Ritchey-Chretien is a modified form of the Cassegrain design, with a concave hyperbolic primary
                        and a convex hyperbolic secondary. The advantage of this design is that both spherical
                        aberration and coma are removed. Astigmatism and field curvature are also reduced, all at the
                        expense of a larger secondary mirror. The shadow of the larger secondary covers some of the
                        primary mirror. Hence the Ritchey-Chretien delivers significantly better imaging performance
                        over a wider field of view than a Cassegrain, but with a slightly lower light grasp. Due to the
                        expense of making hyperbolic mirrors, Ritchey-Chretien designs are usually only found in
                        research telescopes. The best known example of a Ritchey-Chretien telescope is the 2.4m Hubble
                        Space Telescope.</p>

                    <p>So far, we have been considering telescopes composed of only mirrors, or only lenses. Of course,
                        it is possible to combine the two. Telescopes that use both mirrors and lenses are known as
                        catadioptric. They include the <a

                        telescope, built to image very large fields. The field of view of a reflecting telescopes is
                        limited by <a href='#offaxis'>coma</a>
                        to tens of arcseconds. A Schmidt telescope uses lenses and spherical mirrors to image fields up
                        to tens of degrees. </p>
                    <p>Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes are a hybrid of the Schmidt and Cassegrain designs. It is not a
                        telescope you will find in major research observatories, but it is arguably the most widespread
                        design used in the amateur telescope market. A schematic of the Schmidt-Cassegrain design is
                        shown in {%figref "schmidt_cass" %}. The 16-inch telescope on the roof of the Hicks building,
                        and the 10-inch robotic telescope, are both Schmidt-Cassegrain designs.</p>

                    <p>The great advantage of the Schmidt-Cassegrain design is that it is cheap to mass produce, thanks
                        to the use of spherical mirrors. The resulting spherical aberration is dealt with by the
                        corrector lens, a feature it borrows from the Schmidt telescope. Unlike the Schmidt telescope,
                        however, the Schmidt-Cassegrain suffers from off-axis aberrations like coma and astigmatism
                        because the corrector lens is not placed at the centre of curvature. The Schmidt-Cassegrain
                        retains one of the main advantages of the Cassegrain - a long focal length in a short tube,
                        giving a telescope which is compact and portable yet able to provide small enough plate scales
                        for detailed planetary viewing. This versatility makes them ideal for the amateur astronomy
                        market. The typical focal ratio of a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope is f/10 and they are available
                        in apertures ranging from approximately 4-16 inches. Larger apertures become impractical due to
                        the cost of manufacturing the corrector and mounting it without flexure (especially if the
                        secondary mirror is attached to it).</p>
