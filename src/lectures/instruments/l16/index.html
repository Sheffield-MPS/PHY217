                    <p>In the <a href="../l15/">previous lecture</a> we saw the basics of spectrograph design, and used
                        an idealised grating with only two lines to derive the <a href="../l15/#gratingeqn">grating
                            equation</a>. However, astronomical gratings can have many thousands of lines ruled onto
                        their surface. Why? In addition, the gaps between the lines (which act as secondary sources)
                        have a finite thickness. How does this affect the diffraction pattern produced by the grating?

                    <p>We shall ignore for a moment the effect of the finite size of the gaps, and look at the effect of
                        multiple lines. {%figref "multi_lined_grating", true %} shows a multi-lined grating, with 4 gaps
                        between the ruled lines acting as secondary sources. I have chosen \(\theta\) such that the
                        bottom two gaps have a path difference \(d\sin\theta\) which is almost equal to a whole number
                        of wavelengths. If these were the only two gaps we would almost have constructive interference,
                        and the diffraction pattern in this direction would be quite bright.</p>
                    <p>However, the path difference between the first gap and successive gaps is larger. This means that
                        we are adding light that is increasingly out of phase. From the diagram we see the \(N^{\rm
                        th}\) gap would have a path difference of \(Nd\sin\theta\). For large enough \(N\) this will
                        destructively interfere with the light from the first gap, reducing the brightness of the
                        diffraction pattern. The effect of multiple slits is therefore to make the diffraction pattern
                        drop off more rapidly away from the peaks. The rate at which the diffraction pattern drops off
                        in intensity increases with a larger number of lines. This is shown in {%figref
                        "grating_diffraction_patterns" %}. </p>
                    <p>Another effect of multiple lines is also shown in {%figref "multi_lined_grating" %}. Notice that
                        when the phase difference between the first two slits is \(\lambda\), the phase difference
                        between slits one and three is \(2\lambda\) and so on. Thus in direction we
                        <strong>still</strong> have constructive interference. Adding mutliple slits has not changed the
                        position of the maxima, and they still obey the grating equation.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, away from the main peaks, we will get smaller sub-peaks, where pairs of gaps (say, gap 2
                        and gap 4) constructively interfere. These smaller peaks are shown in {%figref
                        "grating_diffraction_patterns" %}.</p>

                    <p>What about the finite width of the gaps? {%figref "grating_diffraction_patterns", true %} shows
                        the familiar diffraction pattern you would get from a single gap of finite width. The effect of
                        many gaps of finite width is to multiply the idealised (narrow gaps) patterns by the diffraction
                        pattern of a single gap. This makes the zeroth order the brightest by far. In figure 86 I have
                        used relatively narrow gaps, so the diffraction pattern of a single gap is quite wide. In real
                        spectrographs the gaps are wider than this, and the zeroth order is much brighter than the first
                        and second orders. This is a problem that must be addressed, as the zeroth order is undispersed
                        and not useful for spectroscopy! By ruling the lines at an angle to the surface of the grating -
                        known as a blaze - we can direct light into the order of interest. For the curious, this is
                        explained in more detail in Vik Dhillon's <a

                    <h5>Spectral Range and Order Overlap</h5>
                    <p>A big problem for spectrographs is that the various orders overlap. This is shown in {%figref
                        "order_overlap" %}, and can be understood from the grating equation, \(n\lambda = d\sin\theta\).
                        At
                        any given angle \(\theta\) the light could have wavelength \(\lambda/n\) for \(n=1,2,3...\). The
                        way
                        round this is to insert <strong>order sorting filters</strong> into the collimated beam, which
                        only
                        allow a restricted wavelength range to pass, avoiding overlap. However, this obviously restricts
                        the
                        range of the spectrograph. The best case is in the first order, where for a given wavelength
                        \(\lambda\), a spectral range of order \(\lambda\) is observable without overlap. </p>

                    <h5>Dispersion</h5>
                    <p>In a given order, what is the relationship between wavelength \(\lambda\) and angle \(\theta\)?
                        We
                        can use the grating equation \(n\lambda = d\sin\theta\) to show
                        \[\frac{d\theta}{d\lambda} = \frac{n}{d \cos\theta}.\]
                        This is known as the angular dispersion (measured in, say, radians per Angstrom) and it is
                        greater
                        for small line spacings, \(d\). It also increases with spectral order \(n\). It is usually more
                        convenient to talk about the linear dispersion - the rate at which \(\lambda\) changes with
                        distance
                        along the detector \(x\). If the spectrograph camera has a focal length \(F_{\rm cam}\), then an
                        angle \(\theta\) corresponds to a position \(x = F_{\rm cam} \theta\). Therefore
                        \[ \frac{dx}{d\lambda} = \frac{dx}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{d\lambda} = \frac{nF_{\rm
                        cam}}{d\cos\theta}.\]
                        The diffraction angle \(\theta\) is usually quite small, so we can write \( dx/d\lambda \approx
                        nF_{\rm cam}/d\). The linear dispersion thus increases with the focal length of the camera, the
                        spectral order, and increases with smaller line spacings. </p>
                    <p>The equation above is often inverted to give the reciprocal linear dispersion, i.e. the
                        wavelength
                        range for a particular length at the detector.</p>
                    <p>What kind of line spacings are practical? For a given size of chip, \(\Delta x\), the range of
                        wavelengths covered will be given by \(\Delta\lambda\), where
                        \[\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\Delta x} = \frac{d}{nF_{\rm cam}}.\]
                        There is no point in this spectral range being larger than the amount which would cause order
                        overlap. If we are working in the first order, \(n=1\), this is of order \(\lambda\). So we have
                        \(\Delta \lambda \approx d \Delta x/F_{\rm cam} \sim \lambda \), which we can re-write to get a
                        lower limit on the line spacing as
                        \[\frac{d}{\lambda} \sim F_{\rm cam} \Delta x.\]
                        A typical CCD has a size of roughly 3 cm. A reasonable choice for line spacing would be
                        \(d/\lambda
                        \sim 10\) - this would imply a camera of focal length 30 cm. Wider spaced rulings with
                        \(d/\lambda
                        \sim 100\) would need a camera of focal length 3 m, which would be as big as a moderately large
                        telescope!</p>
                    <p>At optical wavelengths of \(\lambda = 500\) nm, \(d/\lambda \sim 10\) implies \(d = 5\mu\)m. This
                        is
                        often expressed in the number of lines per mm - in this case 200 lines/mm. For a reasonable
                        sized
                        camera and observing in the first order, this would give a spectral range roughly the same as
                        the
                        limit imposed by order overlap. We could use smaller line spacings to increase the dispersion at
                        the
                        expense of spectral range - such gratings might have 1,000 lines/mm. To see why we would do
                        this, we
                        need to look at what sets the <strong>spectral resolution</strong> of a spectrograph.</p>

                    <h5>Spectral Resolution</h5>
                    <p>The concept of spectral resolution is closely linked to spatial resolution, which we discussed in
                        the
                        <a href="../../principles/l01/">first lecture</a>. Diffraction gratings with more lines produce
                        sharper diffraction patterns, allowing us to resolve two neighbouring wavelengths. This is shown
                        schematically in {%figref "grating_resolution" %}. We can apply the same Rayleigh Criterion we
                        adopted for imaging and say that two wavelengths are resolved when the peak of one diffraction
                        pattern lies on top of the minimum of the other. To find the resolution of a spectrograph we
                        thus
                        need to find the distance to the first minimum.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="cell small-8">{%showfigure "grating_resolution" %}</div>
                <div class="cell">
                    <p>It is possible to show that the diffraction pattern produced by a grating with \(N\) lines, each
                        of
                        width \(a\) and with spacing \(d\) is given by
                        \[I = I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right)^2 \left( \frac{\sin N\beta}{\sin \beta}
                        \right)^2,\]
                        where \(\alpha = (\pi a / \lambda) \sin\theta\) and \(\beta = (\pi d / \lambda) \sin\theta\).
                    </p>
                    <p>The zeros of this pattern are given when \(\sin N\beta = 0\), which can be manipulated to show
                        \[\sin\theta_{\rm zeroes} = \frac{n'\lambda}{Nd},\]
                        where \(n'\) is an integer that labels the zeros, i.e \(n' = 1,2,3...\). To get the angular
                        distance
                        from one zero to the next we note that \(\Delta \theta = \Delta n' \frac{d\theta}{dn'}\), and
                        \(\Delta n' = 1\) - which gives \(\Delta \theta = \lambda/Nd\cos\theta\). Since \(\theta\) is
                        small
                        we can use \(\cos\theta \approx 1 \) to give
                        \[\Delta\theta \sim \frac{\lambda}{Nd}.\]
                        This is the angle between one zero to the next, and it depends on the wavelength, the number of
                        lines and the line spacing. However, we really want to know what wavelength range this angle
                        corresponds to. For that we can use \(\Delta\lambda = \Delta \theta \frac{d\lambda}{d\theta}\).
                        We
                        showed <a href="#dispersion">above</a>, using the grating equation, that
                        \(\frac{d\lambda}{d\theta}
                        = d\cos\theta / n \approx d/n\). Therefore, we have
                        \[\Delta \lambda = \lambda / Nn.\]
                        This is usually expressed as the resolving power of a spectrograph \(R = \lambda / \Delta
                        \lambda =
                        Nn\). The resolving power can be increased by working in a higher order, or by increasing the
                        total
                        number of lines in the grating, \(N\). For a fixed-size grating, this means increasing the
                        number of
                        lines/mm. </p>
                    <p>The resolution discussed above is the limit imposed by diffraction. However, just as in imaging,
                        other factors mean that the <strong>diffraction limited resolution</strong> may not be reached.
                        The
                        spectral resolution of a spectrograph is usually limited by the slit width, or the physical size
                        of
                        the pixels in the CCD, as described below.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Slit Width</strong></h6>
                    <p>The diffraction patterns shown above are the result of the light from a point source falling on
                        the
                        grating. However, we have seen that it is useful to think of a spectrum as essentially an
                        infinite
                        number of images of the slit, each shifted slightly in wavelength. If the projected slit width
                        at
                        the detector is much less than the limiting resolution of the spectrograph, then no loss of
                        resolution will result. However, if the slit is widened so that the width of its image in the
                        spectrum rises above the limiting resolution, then it is the width of the slit that will define
                        the
                        resolution of the spectrum, not diffraction.</p>
                    <p>To maximise spectral resolution, therefore, it seems obvious that the slit width should always be
                        kept smaller than the limiting resolution. Unfortunately, this is rarely possible, as the slit
                        would
                        be so narrow compared to the seeing disc of the star that very little light would pass into the
                        spectrograph. This trade-off between spectral resolution and throughput is illustrated in
                        {%figref
                        "slit_width_resoln" %}, which shows images of the same star passing through a wide slit and a
                        narrow
                        slit. In the wide slit case, all of the light is able to pass into the spectrograph, but the
                        resolution would be defined by the seeing (and image motion due to guiding errors), not the
                        slit. In
                        the narrow slit case, the resolution of the spectrograph would be defined by the width of the
                        slit
                        and would more closely approach the limiting resolution, but only a fraction of the light from
                        the
                        star would pass through the slit.</p>

                    <h6><strong>detector pixel size</strong></h6>
                    <p>The size of the pixels in the CCD detector also has an influence on the effective resolution of a
                        spectrograph. Specifically, if our pixels are larger than a resolution element, the resolution
                        will
                        be set by the size of our pixels. As with imaging, we usually try to have at least two pixels
                        per
                        resolution element for optimal sampling.

                        Since in practice it is the slit width that usually defines the spectral resolution,
                        spectrographs
                        are usually designed so that the slit is matched in width to the seeing, and projects to two
                        pixels
                        on the detector.

                        All of this can be quite confusing, and it is a common mistake to mix up spectral resolution and
                        dispersion. The best way of clarifying this is to go through a <a href="#example">worked
                            example</a>.</p>
                    <h5>Spectral resolution and velocities</h5>
                    <p>As a rough guide, spectrographs with \(R < 1000\) are regarded as low resolution and they
                            generally do not allow the spectral lines from astronomical sources to be resolved.
                            Spectrographs with \(1000 < R < 10,000\) are regarded as intermediate resolution, and these
                            do enable the study of the broadest spectral lines. However, only high-resolution
                            spectrographs, with \(R> 10,000\),
                            enable the narrow spectral lines emitted by most stars to be studied in detail. Note that,
                            in
                            comparison, broad-band photometry has an effective spectral resolution of \(R \sim 5\). </p>
                    <p>One use of spectra is to measure the Doppler shifts of spectral lines. The smallest shift that
                        can be
                        detected is set by the spectral resolution. Since the Doppler shift is given by \(\Delta\lambda
                        /
                        \lambda = \Delta v/c\), and the resolving power \(R = \lambda / \Delta \lambda\), it follows
                        that
                        the smallest velocity shift that can be measured by a spectrograph is roughly
                        \[\Delta v = c/R.\]
                        For intermediate resolution spectrographs with \(R\sim 3000\), this corresponds to velocities of
                        order 100 km/s. To detect the tiny Doppler wobbles induced by exoplanets, which are of order
                        metres
                        per second, requires very high spectral resolution.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>A grating of width 50 mm and 300 lines/mm is used to create a second order
                                    spectrum. What is the limiting spectral resolution at 500 nm?</strong></p>
                            <p>The diffraction limit to resolution is \(\Delta \lambda = \lambda / Nn\). In this case
                                \(n=2\) and \(N = 50 \times 300 = 15000\) lines. Therefore
                                \[\Delta \lambda = \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 15000} = 1.8 \times 10^{-11} {\rm
                                m} = 0.18 \unicode{xC5}.\]</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>If the spectrograph has a camera of focal length 300 mm, what is the reciprocal
                                    linear dispersion in \( \unicode{xC5}\)/mm?</strong></p>
                            <p>The reciprocal linear dispersion is given by the inverse of the linear dispersion
                                \[\frac{d\lambda}{dx} = d\cos\theta / n F_{\rm cam} \approx d/nF_{\rm cam}.\]
                                Since the grating has 300 lines/mm the line spacing is 3 \(\mu\)m. Remembering that
                                \(n=2\), we have
                                \[\frac{d\lambda}{dx} = \frac{3\times 10^{-6}}{2 \times 300 \times 10^{-3}} =
                                5\times10^{-6}.\]
                                Units get a bit confusing here. The above reciprocal dispersion is in meters per meter.
                                We want to convert it to \(\unicode{xC5}\) per mm, so we multiply by \(10^7\) to get
                                \[\frac{d\lambda}{dx} = 50 \, \unicode{xC5} \, {\rm mm}^{-1}.\]</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong> If the detector has 15 \(\mu\)m pixels, will we achieve the diffraction limited
                                    resolution?</strong></p>
                            <p>Each pixel is \(15\times 10^{-3}\) mm. With a reciprocal linear dispersion of \(50
                                \,\unicode{xC5} \, {\rm mm}^{-1}\), one pixel corresponds to
                                \[d\lambda = 50 \times 15\times 10^{-3} = 0.75 \unicode{xC5}. \]
                                This is more than the diffraction limited resolution of 0.18 \(\unicode{xC5}\), so we
                                will not reach this limit. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>How might we change the spectrograph to reach the diffraction limit? </strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>It isn't feasible to make CCDs with much smaller pixels. Therefore we need to reduce the
                                reciprocal linear dispersion to 12 \(\unicode{xC5} \, {\rm mm}^{-1}\). Changing the line
                                spacing \(d\) will also affect the diffraction limited resolution. We have to increase
                                the camera focal length. </p>
                            <p>To reach a reciprocal linear dispersion of 12 \(\unicode{xC5} \, {\rm mm}^{-1}\) requires
                                a focal length of 12,500 mm, or 1.25 m! This is similar in size to many telescopes, and
                                illustrates why reaching the diffraction limit is not normally practical.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong> Suppose we leave the spectrograph unchanged. I want to use the spectrograph on a
                                    2m \(f/10\) telescope, where the seeing is 1 arc second. What physical size must the
                                    slit be, and what collimator focal length should I use?</strong></p>
                            <p>If the typical seeing is 1", then it would be best to use a slit width of approximately
                                this size so as to obtain reasonable throughput whilst still ensuring that the
                                resolution of the spectrograph is defined by the slit.</p>
                            <p>For optimal sampling, the 1" slit should project to at least 2 pixels on the detector.
                                The <a href="../../telescopes/l06/#platescale">platescale</a> of the telescope is 206265
                                / 20000 = 10.3 "/mm, so the physical width of the slit is approximately 100 μm, which
                                must project to 2 x 15 = 30 μm. Hence the magnification of the spectrograph must be 0.3,
                                implying that the <a href="../l14/#reimagers">ratio of camera to collimator focal
                                    lengths</a> must also be 0.3. Thus, the collimator focal length must be 900 mm. </p>

                            <p><strong>OK. So what's the resolving power of my spectrograph if I'm observing at 550
                                    nm?</strong></p>
                            <p>The spectral resolution is set by the slit width. The slit projects to 2 pixels, or 30
                                μm. Since the reciprocal linear dispersion is \(50 \,\unicode{xC5} \, {\rm mm}^{-1}\),
                                the resolution is
                                \[\Delta \lambda = 50 \times 30 \times 10^{-3} = 1.5 \unicode{xC5}\].
                                The resolving power is \(R = \lambda / \Delta \lambda = 550 \times 10^{-9} / 1.5 \times
                                10^{-10} \approx 3600\). This is a medium resolution spectrograph.</p>

                                However, the reciprocal linear dispersion will halve. The resolution will therefore
