                    <p>In the <a href="../l12/">previous lecture</a> we saw how to use bias frames, dark frames and flat
                        fields to correct our raw CCD images and prepare them for accurate scientific work, like
                        photometry. In this short practical we will use <a
                            href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/">astroImageJ</a> to process a
                        series of images of M51 taken using the department's 10-inch robotic telescope, <a
                            href="https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/astronomy/rosa-observatory">ROSA</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>AstroImageJ is already installed on the lab PCs. Should you want a copy for your own machine, it
                        is available for <a href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/">download</a>. A
                        detailed and helpful <a
                            href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/guide/AstroImageJ_User_Guide_2.1.4.pdf">manual</a>
                        is available. If you encounter difficulty, or do not understand a setting, check the manual.</p>
                    <p>To open AstroImageJ, double-click the file
                        <kbd>C:\SharedFolder\astrolab\AstroImageJ\ImageJ\AstroImageJ</kbd>.
                    </p>
                    <h5>The Data</h5>
                    <p>You will need a copy of the data. The data files are located at
                        <kbd>C:\SharedFolder\astrolab\M51</kbd>. There are 18 images of M51 in each filter. Also in this
                        directory are three bias frames, three dark frames and three flat fields in each filter.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can work on the data in the <kbd>SharedFolder</kbd>. However, this folder is local to the PC
                        you are working on now. If you want to keep files from this practical to use later, you will
                        need to copy those files to your U: or M: drives. There is just over 100MB of raw data, so make
                        sure you have enough free space before doing this!</p>
                    <h5>Data Processing with astroImageJ</h5>
                    <p>Before you start any data processing job, you should make sure you have the calibration files you
                        need. </p>

                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 0:</strong> Open astroImageJ and open the file named "<kbd>M51_B_001.fit</kbd>".
                            Look at the FITS header metadata by choosing <kbd>Edit > FITS Header</kbd>. Note the filter
                            used and the exposure time. What calibration files will you need for this image? If you're
                            unsure, try and ask.</p>
                        <p>Close this image and the FITS header window.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Data processing in astroImageJ is performed the data processing window, shown in {%figref
                        "aij_dpwin" %}. Your next task is to familiarise yourself with this window.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cell small-11">
                    {%showfigure "aij_dpwin" %}
                </div>

                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Open the data processing window by choosing <kbd>Plugins > Astronomy
                                > Data Processor</kbd>, or by clicking the <span style="color:red;">D</span><span
                                style="color:blue;">P</span> icon in the main astroImageJ window. Two
                            windows will open. Close the one titled "<kbd>DP Coordinate Converter</kbd>" - we won't need
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The data processing (DP) window is shown in {%figref "aij_dpwin" %}. DP operates like a
                            script; it processes selected calibration and science images in a pre-defined way. The DP
                            window is described in full in the astroImageJ <a
                                href="http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/guide/AstroImageJ_User_Guide_2.1.4.pdf">manual</a>.
                            We shall only describe the sections of interest here.</p>
                        <p>The DP window is organized into five sections horizontally and nine sections vertically.
                            Starting from the left, the horizontal sections are:
                        </p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Control</dt>
                            <dd>The control checkboxes determine if master calibration frames are to be built (the
                                <kbd>Build</kbd> checkboxes) and which master frames are to be used (the
                                <kbd>Enable</kbd> checkboxes). For example, if the Bias Subtraction <kbd>Build</kbd> box
                                is checked, as master bias frame will be made. If the bias subtraction <kbd>Enable</kbd>
                                box is checked, the master bias will be subtracted from the science frames.
                            </dd>
                            <dt>Options</dt>
                            <dd>The options checkboxes change the details of how calibration frames are built and used.
                                For example, the <kbd>ave</kbd> and <kbd>med</kbd> radio buttons control if the master
                                calibration frame is created using a mean or a median.</dd>
                            <dt>Directory</dt>
                            <dd>The directory boxes define the directory/folder location of each category of image
                                files. The folder icon to the right of the directory boxes can be used to navigate to
                                the appropriate folders, or the folder name can be typed manually.</dd>
                            <dt>Filename/Pattern</dt>
                            <dd>The filename/pattern boxes specify which files in the directory are to be processed.
                                Wildcard notation can be used to choose all files which match a certain pattern. For
                                example, the pattern "<kbd>bias*.fit</kbd>" will match all filenames which start with
                                "<kbd>bias</kbd>", have any number of other characters, and end in "<kbd>.fit</kbd>".
                                This is very useful for selecting only the bias frames in a certain directory, for
                                example.</dd>
                            <dt>Totals</dt>
                            <dd>The totals column indicates the number of files found that match the pattern specified
                                in the chosen directory. You can use this to check that you are finding the number of
                                files you expect.</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <p>The DP window is also broken into a number of vertical sections:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <kbd>science image processing</kbd> section determines which frames are
                                considered as science frames - these are the frames we wish to de-bias etc. You can
                                select frames by folder, by pattern and also filter based on frame number.</li>
                            <li>The <kbd>Bias Subtraction</kbd>, <kbd>Dark Subtraction</kbd> and <kbd>Flat
                                    Division</kbd> sections determines whether to <kbd>build</kbd> or use
                                (<kbd>enable</kbd>) the master calibration frames. The frames which make up the
                                master calibration frame, and the name and location of the master frame are set
                                using the <kbd>Directory</kbd> and <kbd>Filename/Pattern</kbd> boxes.</li>
                            <li>The <kbd>Non-linearity</kbd>, <kbd>FITS Header Update</kbd> and
                                <kbd>Post-Processing</kbd> sections are not of interest to us in this practical.
                                Make sure they are made inactive by de-selecting the radio boxes in the
                                <kbd>Control</kbd> area of these sections.
                            </li>
                            <li>The <kbd>Save Calibrated Images</kbd> determines where our processed images are
                                saved. We can save to a sub-directory of the main science folder and/or add a suffix
                                to our filenames. Delete any text in the <kbd>suffix</kbd> box, and type
                                "<kbd>calib</kbd>" in the Sub-dir box to save calibrated images to a sub-directory
                                named calib. </li>

                    <h5>Flat Field</h5>
                    <p>Now we need to prepare master flat fields. Since the flat field depends upon the filter used, we
                        need to create a master flat field for each of the B, V and I filters. To start with we will
                        create a flat for the I-band.</p>
                    <p>The flat field images are only very short exposures (less than a couple of seconds), so the dark
                        current in the images will be tiny (You can check this with the measured dark current from
                        earlier). Hence we will not need to subtract a dark from the flat fields. Instead, we create a
                        master flat field by subtracting a bias from each image, normalising each frame, and combining
                        the normalised frames using a median.</p>
                    <div class="callout warning">

                            Subtraction</kbd> area. We do not wish to re-build our master dark, or subtract darks from
                        the flat fields.

                            frame with this name.</p>
                        <p>Check the totals column to ensure you've got your settings right (you should be combining

                            steps taken. Open your masterflat_I.fit frame to check everything looks OK. It should look
                            like {%figref "aij_masterflat" %}, and the average level should be 1 count. </p>
                        <p>Once you're happy with the I-band flat field, make flat fields for the B and V-band filters

                        will start with the I-band data. As a reminder, we will need to subtract a bias and a dark from
                        our science image, and then divide by the master flat field for the appropriate filter. Because
                        the dark frames were taken with a 300 second exposure time, and our science frames were taken
                        with a 200 second exposure time, we will need to scale the master dark frame under the
                        assumption that dark current builds up linearly with time. </p>

                    <p>There will be many occasions when you will want to average several calibrated images of the same
                        target. In this case we want to make a pretty colour image, but more usually you will want to
                        perform photometry on a single image with an improved <a
                            href="../../stats/l18/">signal-to-noise</a> ratio. </p>
                    <p>We can stack our images in astroImageJ by loading them into a virtual stack and using the
                        alignment tools, as we did when we used astroImageJ for <a href="../../principles/p03/">relative
                            photometry</a>. </p>
                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Load the calibrated I-band images into astroImageJ by choosing
                            <kbd>File > Import > Image Sequence</kbd>. Select the calib folder containing the calibrated
                            B, V and I images. When the <kbd>Sequence Options</kbd> window appears, we will need to
                            enter "<kbd>M51_I</kbd>" into the <kbd>File name contains</kbd> box, so that we only load
                            the I-band images into a sequence. Make sure you tick the <kbd>Use Virtual Stack</kbd>

                        </p>
                        <p>Scroll through the images in your sequence. You will notice they are not perfectly aligned,
                            due to imperfections in telescope tracking and autoguiding. </p>
                        <p>Align the images by choosing <kbd>Process > Align stack using WCS or apertures...</kbd> This

                        <p>The radii of the object aperture and sky annuli are not too important, but you might want to
                            make sure the object radius is set to a reasonable value, since if the star lies outside
                            this radius, AstroImageJ will not be able to calculate the image shift. Set this value to
                            somewhere in the range 15-20. </p>
                        <p>Click <kbd>OK</kbd> to begin selecting stars to use for alignment. Left click on a star to
                            add an aperture around it. Add two or three bright stars to use for alignment and press
                            Enter or right-click to begin the alignment procedure.</p>
                        <p>AstroImageJ will now look for a star within each aperture, and measure the centroid of those
                            stars. For each image, it uses the centroid of the stars to estimate the image shift, and
                            saves an aligned version of the image into a subdirectory called <kbd>aligned</kbd>.</p>
                        <p>When AstroImageJ has finished, close the photometry window, and load the aligned images in as
                            an Image Sequence. Once you've loaded the aligned images into the stack, hit the button and
                            check the alignment. <strong>Make sure all 18 images have been successfully

                    <p>At this point you should have a single image for each filter, which is the result of median
                        combining each of the calibrated images in that filter. For something like an open cluster
                        project, these images would be a great starting point for your <a
                            href="../../principles/p05/">absolute photometry</a>. We're going to reward ourselves for
                        all our hard work by making a colour image of M51. </p>
                    <div class="callout warning">
                        <p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Follow the instructions for task 6 to align the three images in each
                            filter.</p>
                        <p>Open the three aligned images in a virtual stack. Combine them into a colour image by
                            choosing <kbd>Color > Make Composite color image</kbd>. A box will appear; use the drop-down
                            menu to select <kbd>Display Mode: Color</kbd>. A second box will appear, with the title
                            <kbd>Channels</kbd> and the check box for Channel 1 selected. </p>
                        <p>We have to assign the correct colour to each channel. astroImageJ doesn't know in advance
                            which file corresponds to which colour. When you check the box for a given channel the image
                            will be displayed, and you can tell from the filename in the main window which file has been
                            put in which channel. If you need to change them, use the button labelled <kbd>More>></kbd>
                            in the <kbd>Channels</kbd> window to choose the appropriate color for each file. You want to
                            place the I-band image in the red channel, the V-band in the green and the B-band in the
                            blue.</p>
                        <p>Once you’ve assigned the correct colour to each channel, you can see the combined results of
                            your work by changing the display mode from <kbd>Color</kbd> to <kbd>Composite</kbd>.
                            Ideally the resulting composite image should show relatively white stars and relatively
                            black sky. You can go back to <kbd>Color</kbd> mode, and adjust the grayscale sliders (or
                            even choose a different display colour for a given master frame) and remake your composite
                            image.</p>
                        <p>To get a nice looking image will take some effort here!</p>
                        <p>To save the combined channels as a single image use the <kbd>More>></kbd> button and the
                            <kbd>Convert to RGB</kbd> option. This will open a new window with a single, combined colour
                            image. Then you can save the combined image in any number of formats using the file menu.
                        </p>
                        <p>With a bit of work, you can re-produce the image shown at the end of the <a
