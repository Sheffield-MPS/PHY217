                    <p>Obtaining spectroscopic data on astronomical objects is at the heart of observational astronomy.
                        <a href="../../principles/l04/">Photometry</a> through different coloured filters can provide
                        crude information on the spectrum of an object, but what if we need finer detail? Perhaps we
                        wish to study the absorption lines present in a star's spectrum, or measure a star's radial
                        velocity through the shift in those lines. The astronomical spectrograph is designed for this
                        purpose. An astronomical spectrograph splits, or disperses, the light from a source into its
                        component wavelengths. Some means of dispersing the light is therefore required. This function
                        used to be performed by a prism, which exploits the fact that light of different wavelengths are
                        refracted by different amounts, with blue light being refracted more than red light. However,
                        prisms are inefficient, as light is lost at each air-glass surface (see {%figref "prism" %}). In
                        addition, the amount of dispersion is not very high, and not easy to control.

                    <h5> Gratings</h5>
                    <p>The almost universal choice for the dispersing element in modern astronomical spectrographs is
                        the diffraction grating. There are two types of diffraction grating in use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a <strong>transmission grating</strong>, where a large number of fine, equidistant, parallel
                            lines are ruled onto a transparent glass plate so that light can pass between the lines, but
                            not through them.</li>
                        <li>a <strong>refection grating</strong>, where the lines are ruled onto a reflective piece of
                            glass so that only the light between the lines is reflected.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Regardless of the grating type, they both work on the same principle. The gaps between the lines act
                    as secondary light sources. In certain directions, these light sources will constructively
                    interfere. This principle is shown in {%figref "two_line_grating" %}.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="cell small-12 medium-4">{%showfigure "two_line_grating" %}</div>
                <div class="cell small-12 medium-8">
                    <p>In {%figref "two_line_grating" %}, I show a simplified diffraction grating, where we have two
                        gaps between the ruled lines acting as secondary sources. The path length between these two
                        sources to a distant detector is given by \(d\phi = d\sin\theta\). When this path length is
                        equal to an integer number of wavelengths, we will get constructive interference. Hence, the
                        condition for constructive interference is written as
                        \[n\lambda = d\sin\theta.\]
                        <a name="gratingeqn"></a>This equation is known as the <strong>grating equation</strong>, and is
                        fundamental to understanding how gratings work.
                    </p>
                    <p>If we imagine monochromatic light falling on our grating, we will get constructive interference,
                        and thus beams of light, where \(n=0,1,2,...\), and so on. These are referred to as the zeroth,
                        first and second <strong>orders</strong>. Now consider what happens when white light is incident
                        on our grating. In the zeroth order, \(n=0\) and the angle at which constructive interference
                        occurs, \(\theta\), is independent of wavelength. The zeroth order is not dispersed. In the
                        first orders \(n = \pm 1\), the grating equation implies that \(\theta\) must increase as
                        \(\lambda\) increases. Thus, the angle at which constructive inteference occurs is wavelength
                        dependent, and dispersion occurs. This is shown in {%figref "diffraction_pattern" %}.</p>

                    <h5>Basic spectrograph design</h5>
                    <p>Most spectrographs use the same design, based on the <a href="../l14/#reimagers">re-imager</a> we
                        saw in the previous lecture. Schematics of spectrographs, using transmission and reflection
                        gratings, are shown in {%figref "spectrograph_designs" %}. The five basic components of an
                        astronomical spectrograph are the slit, collimator, grating, camera and detector. The roles of
                        each of these components are described in more detail below.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cell small-11">
                    {%showfigstack "spectrograph_designs" %}
                </div>
                <div class="cell">
                    <h6><strong>Slit</strong></h6>
                    <p>The slit is a mask with a narrow rectangular aperture that is placed in the focal plane of the
                        telescope. The slit has two main functions. First, the slit acts as a means of isolating the
                        region of interest on the sky. Without a slit present, the spectra from sources either side of
                        the target would overlap {%figref "slitless" %}, contaminating the target spectrum. Additional
                        sky background from either side of the target would also be recorded, degrading the
                        signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum. By putting a slit in the focal plane of the telescope,
                        only light falling on the slit may enter the spectrograph, as shown in {%figref "slit_example"
                        %}. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="cell small-11">
                    {%showfigstack "slitless" %}
                    {%showfigstack "slit_example" %}
                </div>
                <div class="cell">
                    <p>The second function of the slit is to provide stable spectral resolution. This can be understood
                        by noting that a spectrum is essentially an infinite number of images of the telescope focal
                        plane, each shifted slightly in wavelength. Hence, without a slit present, the spectral
                        resolution of an object would be defined by the width of the object. For a point source like a
                        star the would be defined by the seeing. However, since seeing varies with time, the spectral
                        resolution would then vary with time. The solution is to illuminate a narrow slit with the
                        source, so that the spectrum becomes an infinite number of images of the slit, not the source.
                        The minimum width of any spectral lines would then be defined by the slit width, and would hence
                        be stable.</p>
                    <p>Spectrographs re-image, or project, the slit in the focal plane of the telescope onto the
                        detector, which lies in the focal plane of the camera. As we discovered when looking at <a
                            href="../l14/#reimagers">re-imagers</a>, the ratio of the camera to collimator focal lengths
                        determines the magnification of the image of the slit on the detector: \(M = F_{\rm cam} /
                        F_{\rm coll}\). Hence a slit of width 50 μm in a spectrograph with a collimator of focal length
                        500 mm and camera of focal length 250 mm would be projected to a width of 25 μm on the detector.
                        We will see what sets the optimal slit width, when we discuss spectral resolution in the
                        <a href="../l16/">next lecture</a>.

                <div class="cell small-12 medium-7">
                    <p>When we derived the grating equation, we assumed the light was arriving perpendicular to the
                        grating. In general the light will arrive at the grating at an angle \(\phi\), and this will
                        add an additional phase shift to the light emerging from each gap between the grating lines.
                        The situation is shown in {%figref "full_grating_eq" %}.
                    </p>
                    <p>In {%figref "full_grating_eq" %}, we see that the new phase shift between the two sources is
                        \(x + y\). Since \(x = d\sin\phi\) and \(y = d\sin\theta\), a modified version of the
                        grating equation to account for this is
                        \[n\lambda = d (\sin\theta + \sin\phi).\]
                        Without a collimator, the diverging light from the slit would hit the grating, resulting in
                        variable angles of incidence as a function of position on the grating. From the equation
                        above, we see that varying the angle of incidence, \(\phi\), results in changes to the angle
                        of diffraction, \(\theta\). Hence the same wavelength of light in the same order would be
                        imaged onto different positions on the detector, blurring the resulting spectrum. With a
                        collimator, however all angles of incidence on the grating are equal and no such blurring would
                        result.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Grating</strong></h6>
                    <p>As discussed above, the grating splits the light into its component wavelengths. The modified
                        grating equation above shows that by varying \(\phi\), the wavelength that gets diffracted into
                        angle \(\theta\) can be varied. This will affect the location on the detector of each
                        wavelength. Hence most spectrographs have gratings that can be tilted in order to adjust the
                        start and end wavelengths of the spectrum.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Camera</strong></h6>
                    <p>The role of the camera in an astronomical spectrograph is to collect the spectrally-dispersed
                        beams from the grating, which are still collimated, and make them converge so that the spectrum
                        is imaged onto the detector. The camera can be either a lens, mirror, or catadioptric system.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Detector</strong></h6>
                    <p>The dispersed light is ultimately imaged by the spectrograph onto the detector, forming a
                        spectrum, as shown in the bottom-right panel of {%figref "slit_example" %}. We can define the
                        direction along the slit (i.e. the vertical direction in the right panel of {%figref
                        "slit_example" %}) as the spatial axis, and the direction along the spectrum (i.e. the
                        horizontal direction in the right panel of {%figref "slit_example" %}) as the dispersion
                        axis.</p>
