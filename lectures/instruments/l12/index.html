                    <p>In the <a href="../l11/">previous lecture</a>, we covered the basics of how CCDs work. Once we
                        have taken our CCD image we'd like to use it for some scientific purpose. For example, we might
                        wish to perform <a href="../../principles/l02/">relative</a> or <a
                            href="../../principles/l04/">absolute photometry</a> on the stars in the image. However,
                        before we can do that, we must perform some additional processing on the image. To understand
                        why, we need to look at some details of CCD operation.</p>
                    <h5>Bias Frames</h5>
                    <p>Let's recall how a CCD measures the number of electrons \(N_e\) in each pixel. These electrons
                        have a total charge \(Q = eN_e\). We measure this charge by dumping it onto a capacitor with
                        capacitance \(C\) and measuring the voltage \(V = Q/C\). We can re-write the number of electrons
                        in terms of this tiny, analog voltage as
                        \[N_e = CV/e.\]
                        In other words, the voltage is proportional to the number of electrons. Because we need to store
                        the data in digital format, the analog voltage is converted to a digital number of counts
                        \(N_c\), by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Since the value in counts is proportional to
                        the voltage \(N_c \propto V\), it follows that the number of counts is proportional to the
                        number of photo-electrons, i.e \(N_e = GN_c\), where \(G\) is the Gain, measured in e-/ADU. The
                        number of bits used by the ADC to store the count values limits the number of different count
                        values that can be represented. For a 16-bit ADC, we can represent count values from 0 to
                        65,535. </p>
                    <p>Now, imagine a relatively short exposure, taken from a <a href="../../telescopes/l09/">dark
                            astronomical site</a>. Suppose that the gain, \(G=1\) e-/ADU and that in our short exposure
                        we create, on average, two photo-electrons from the sky in each pixel. Because of <a
                            href="../l11/#readout">readout noise</a>, we will NOT have 2 counts in each pixel. Instead,
                        the pixel values will follow a Gaussian distribution, with a mean of 2 counts, and a standard
                        deviation given by the readout noise, which may be of the order of 3 counts. It should be
                        obvious that this implies that many pixels should contain negative count values. However, our
                        ADC cannot represent numbers less than 0! This means our data has been corrupted by the
                        digitisation process. If we didn't fix this, it would cause all sorts of problems: in this case
                        it would lead us to over-estimate the sky level.</p>
                    <p>The solution is to apply a <strong>bias voltage</strong>. This is a constant offset voltage
                        applied to the capacitor before analog-to-digital conversion. The result is that, even if the
                        pixel contains no photo-electrons, the ADC returns a value of a few hundred counts, nicely
                        solving the issue of negative counts. However, it does mean that we must correct for the bias
                        level when doing photometry! Each pixel in our image contains counts from stars, from the sky
                        background and from the bias level. We must subtract the bias level before performing
                        photometry. </p>
                    <p>How do we know what the bias level is? The easiest way to do this is to take a series of images
                        with zero exposure time. Because there is no exposure time, these images contain no
                        photo-electrons, and no thermally excited electrons. These images, known as bias frames, allow
                        us to measure the bias level, and subtract it from our science data. A bias frame is shown in
                        <a href="#figure73">figure 73</a>. Several bias frames are needed because the value of any pixel in a given
                        bias frame will differ from the bias level due to readout noise. Averaging several frames
                        together reduces the impact of readout noise and gives a more accurate estimate of the bias
                        level. The master bias frame produced from this averaging can be subtracted from all science
                        images to remove the bias level from each pixel. </p>

                    <h5>Dark Frames</h5>
                    <p>Recall that photo-electrons are produced in CCDs by photons exciting electrons from the valence
                        band to the conduction band. However, this is not the only way to excite electrons into the
                        conduction band. <strong>Thermal excitation</strong> is also capable of producing electrons in
                        the conduction band. Thermal excitation of electrons is known as <strong>dark current</strong>
                        and the electrons produced by it are indistinguishable from photo-electrons.</p>
                    <p>Dark current can be very substantial. At room temperature, the dark current of a standard CCD is
                        typically 100,000 e-/pixel/s, which is sufficient to saturate most CCDs in only a few seconds!
                        The solution is to cool the CCD. The typical operating temperatures of CCDs are in the range 150
                        to 263 K (i.e. -123 to -10&#8451;). At major observatories, most CCDs are cooled to the bottom
                        end of this range, generally using liquid nitrogen. The resulting dark current can be as low as
                        a few electrons per pixel per hour. The CCDs on the Hicks telescopes are air-cooled to a few
                        degrees below zero, and have dark currents of around 40 e-/pixel/hour. </p>
                    <p>Neither of these values are negligible, especially for short exposures. Thus, every pixel in our
                        image contains contributions from stars, sky background, bias level and dark current. The dark
                        current must be measured, and subtracted from our science images for the same reasons as the
                        bias level. For this purpose <strong>dark frames</strong> are taken. These are long exposures,
                        taken with the shutter closed. These frames will have no contribution from photo-electrons, but
                        they will contain dark current and the bias level. This means that dark frames must have the
                        bias subtracted from them before use. Once the bias level has been subtracted off, several dark
                        frames can be combined to make a master dark frame, which can be subtracted from your images.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is best to combine the dark frames using the median, rather than the mean. Dark frames are
                        often long exposures, which can be affected by <strong>cosmic rays</strong>. Cosmic rays hitting
                        the CCD will excite also excite electrons. Taking the median of the master dark will help remove
                        cosmic rays from the master dark frame.</p>
                    <p>Because the dark frame increases with time, it is easiest if the dark frames have the same
                        exposure time as your science images. If they do not, it is possible to <strong>scale</strong>
                        the dark frame by the ratio of exposure times, since dark current increases (roughly) linearly
                        with time. Dark current is also a strong function of temperature - it is essential that dark
                        frames are taken with the CCD at the same temperature as your science frame. </p>
                    <p><a href="#figure74">Figure 74</a> shows an example dark frame. In this 300-sec exposure the dark current
                        is about 50 counts. Note that not every pixel has the same value. Some of this is read noise,
                        but it is also true that different pixels in a CCD show different levels of dark current. Some
                        pixels show very high levels of dark current - these so called <strong>hot pixels</strong> can
                        have a very serious effect on your photometry if your target star happens to lie on top of one.

                    <h5>Flat Fields</h5>
                    <p>Suppose we use our telescope and CCD to take an image of a perfectly uniform light source. Would
                        every pixel have the same number of counts in it? No - as we have seen each pixel will have a
                        varying contribution from dark current and readout noise. What if we ignored these effects? The
                        answer is still no. Various effects combine to mean that the count level can vary significantly
                        across the image. <a href="#figure75">Figure 75</a> shows an image of the twilight sky taken with the
                        ROSA telescope on the roof of the Hicks building. On the small image scale of a telescope, the
                        twilight sky is an excellent approximation to a uniformly illuminated light source. However,
                        <a href="#figure75">figure 75</a> is far from uniform. </p>

                    <p>There are three main reasons for the structure seen in <a href="#figure75">figure 75</a>. </p>

                        <dd>
                            Consider the design of the Newtonian telescope shown in figure 41. If the secondary mirror
                            is exactly the right size to fit the beam produced by an on-axis source, some fraction of
                            the beam produced by an off-axis source will miss the secondary mirror. This light will be
                            lost, and off-axis sources will appear dimmer than on-axis sources. This is vignetting, and
                            its effect is clearly visible in <a href="#figure75">figure 75</a>.

                        <dt>Pixel-to-Pixel variations</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Each pixel in a CCD is not exactly the same size; manufacturing tolerances mean that some
                            pixels are larger than others. If each CCD pixel is exposed to a constant flux, the
                            variation in pixel area means that some pixels will capture more photons than others. This
                            effect can also be seen in <a href="#figure75">figure 75</a> if you look closely, and is often called flat
                            field <strong>grain</strong>.

                        <dd>
                            Dust grains on the window of the CCD, or on the filters will block out a small fraction of
                            the light falling on the CCD. These grains appear as dark donuts, with the size of the donut
                            depending on how far from the focal plane the dust grain is. Two such donuts are visible in
                            <a href="#figure75">figure 75</a>.
                        </dd>

                    <h6><strong>Flat field frames</strong></h6>
                    <p>It is essential to correct our images for these effects. If we did not, the number of counts from
                        an object would vary depending upon its location in the image, ruining our photometry.
                        Fortunately, we can correct these effects using flat field frames. These are images taken of the
                        twilight sky, which is assumed to be uniform (this is a good assumption for most instruments).
                        Any variation in the flat field is therefore due to the effects above. Because vignetting and
                        the contribution from dust grains can depend on the filter, flat fields must be taken in the
                        same filters as your science data.</p>
                    <p>For small telescopes, it can be more convenient to use a specially constructed <strong>flat-field
                            panel</strong>, such as the one shown in <a href="#figure76">figure 76</a>. These panels are
                        carefully designed to provide a uniform light source. The advantage of a flat field panel over
                        the twilight sky is that flat fields can be taken at any time, whereas twilight flats can only
                        be taken in a narrow window after sunset. </p>
                    <p>How should the flat field be used? First of all, we must realise that the flat field image must
                        be bias subtracted. Dark frame subtraction is not normally necessary, since exposure times are
                        short and the dark current will be very small. The count level of pixel \((i,j)\) in the
                        bias-subtracted flat field image can be written as
                        \[F_{ij} = \alpha_{ij} F,\]
                        where F is the uniform flux of the twilight sky, or flat field panel. The quantity
                        \(\alpha_{ij}\) represents the fraction of light lost to vignetting, pixel-to-pixel variations
                        and dust grains. If we normalise our image, i.e. divide the flat field by the mean flux, \(F\),
                        we get an image whose brightness \(f\) is given by \(f_{ij} = \alpha_{ij}\). Our science image
                        is given by the product of the flux falling on each pixel \(G_{ij}\), and the flat field
                        effects, giving an image in which the brightness of pixel (i,j) is given by
                        \[G'_{ij} = G_{ij}\alpha_{ij}.\]
                        Dividing our science image, \(G'_{ij}\) by the normalised flat field image, \(\alpha_{ij}\),
                        gives the actual flux falling on each pixel \(G_{ij}\), as desired. </p>

                    <h5>A worked example - M52</h5>
                    <p>
                        The calibration frames shown in the figures above were taken to support observations with ROSA
                        of the nearby galaxy M52, by a first year student in 2012. A raw CCD image in the I-band is
                        shown in <a href="#figure77">figure 77</a>. Five sets of each calibration frame were taken. The five biasses
                        were median-combined to make a master bias. The darks were bias-subtracted and median-combined
                        to make a master dark. The flat field images were bias subtracted and median-combined to make a
                        master flat, which was normalised. The raw CCD image then had the master dark and bias frames
                        subtracted, and was divided by the normalised master flat to make the calibrated CCD image, also
                        shown in <a href="#figure77">figure 77</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Note that the calibrated image has had the dark current from hot pixels removed. If you look
                        closely, you can also see that the illumination across the frame is even (as vignetting has been
                        corrected), and that the pixel-to-pixel variations have been removed. </p>
                    <p>Many science images in the BVI filters were taken, and calibrated as above. These were then
                        aligned to correct for imperfections in telescope tracking, and combined into the colour image
                        seen in <a href="#figure78">figure 78</a>. </p>
